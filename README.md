Tired of manually defining appwrite collections and their attributes in a constantly changing project?  
Define annotated classes with dart and let awogen create :

- the corresponding collections with attributes
- the final classes with fields mapping to collection attributes so you can you use autocompletion inside your IDE
- helper functions to read and write data

## Getting started

check  
[examples/awogen_cli_example/README.MD](examples/awogen_cli_example/README.md)  
and  
[examples/awogen_flutter_example/README.MD](examples/awogen_flutter_example/README.md)  
for instructions.

### TODO

- add more definitions: required, default, support arrays
- add more helper functions in dart appwrite classes
- target other languages?
